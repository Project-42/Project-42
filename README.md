- :warning: **Iâ€™m working with and for Oracle since 2012 and as you probably guess, opinions here are my own**

Experienced Oracle DBA on versions 11g/12c/18c/19c, specializing in Exadata and other Oracle engineered systems like SuperCluster and Oracle Cloud deployments (both OCI and ExaCC/ExaCS)

Working directly for some of Oracle biggest International Clients, I am committed to deliver excellent customer service ensuring high standard customer satisfaction.

With my clear logical mind and a practical hands on approach to problem solving, I can ensure that presented tasks will be handled through to completion in an efficient and professional manner.

Currently publishing guides and knowledge articles about my areas of expertise on a sporadic base and updating newly acquired knowledge.

The reason for this website and probably my life right now, is to search for new things to learn and new questions to ask, after all, we should listen to Deep Thought and make sure we get the questions right

Hope you enjoy what you can see here, but if you need more Oracle content, please visit some of these Blogs, they are really awesome and I most of the stuff you see here, are probably related to them ðŸ™‚



- ðŸŒ± Always learning something new related or not to Databases or Oracle ðŸ™‚
